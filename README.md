**Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)** is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

The implementation approach is inspired by [DRQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051) and [FastQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04816).
[Here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/2761899.pdf) is yet another simple and interesting approach to get started.

### Pre-requisites for running the notebook
1. Python 3.x
2. tensorflow 
3. Keras 
4. Pre-trained [gloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)  
5. SQuAD Dataset: Download it from [here](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)
